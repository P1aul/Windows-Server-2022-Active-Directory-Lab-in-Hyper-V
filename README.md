# **7. Identifying and Configuring NIC IP Settings**

In this step, we will identify the serverâ€™s network interfaces (NICs) and configure the **Internal (Office)** NIC with a static IP address to ensure reliable communication within the private network. The **External (Internet)** NIC will remain configured to use DHCP to automatically obtain an IP address from the router for internet connectivity.

## **Step 7.1**  
Under **Local Server** in **Server Manager**, click on one of the **`IPv4 address assigned by DHCP, IPv6 enabled`** links. This will open the **Network Connections** window.  

> [!TIP]  
> Accessing the **Network Connections** window makes it easier to identify and configure multiple NICs for distinct purposes.

![image](Images/38.png)

---

## **Step 7.2**  
In the **Network Connections** window, you will see two Ethernet connections. To identify which is internal and which is external, right-click each NIC, select **`Status`**, and then click **`Details`**.  

![image](Images/39.png)  
![image](Images/40.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> Viewing the **Details** of each NIC will reveal key information, like assigned IP addresses, helping differentiate their roles.

---

## **Step 7.3**  
In the **Network Connection Details** window:  
- **Ethernet**: Displays an address like `169.254.x.x`, which is an APIPA address. This indicates the NIC is likely the **Internal NIC**, as it could not get an IP address from the router via DHCP.  
- **Ethernet 2**: Displays an address like `192.168.x.x`, assigned by the router via DHCP, making it the **External NIC**.

> [!TIP]  
> APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) addresses, like `169.254.x.x`, are self-assigned by Windows when no DHCP server is available.  

Rename the NICs accordingly (e.g., **Internal (Office)** and **External (Internet)**) to track their roles.  

![image](Images/41.png)  
![image](Images/42.png)

---

## **Step 7.4**  
Now that the NICs are identified, assign a static IP address to the **Internal (Office)** NIC. Right-click the renamed NIC, select **`Properties`**, then select **`Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`** and click **`Properties`**.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Assigning a static IP ensures consistent communication within the domain. Using a dynamic IP (via DHCP) could lead to connectivity issues if the address changes unexpectedly.

![image](Images/43.png)  
![image](Images/44.png)

---

## **Step 7.5**  
In the IPv4 settings, change from **`Obtain an IP address automatically`** to **`Use the following IP address`**. Enter the following:  
- **IP Address**: `10.10.0.1`  
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`  
- **Default Gateway**: Leave this blank.  
- **DNS Server**: Use either `10.10.0.1` (server IP) or `127.0.0.1` (loopback address).

> [!TIP]  
> The loopback address (`127.0.0.1`) allows the server to resolve its own hostname without querying an external DNS server.  

![image](Images/45.png)

---

## **Step 7.6**  
The **External (Internet)** NIC is already set to receive an IP address via DHCP from the router. No further configuration is needed for this NIC.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Configuring the External NIC for DHCP allows it to dynamically receive an IP address from the router, simplifying the setup process for internet connectivity.  

![image](Images/46.png)

# **9. Promoting the Server to a Domain Controller**

In this step, we will configure the server as a **Domain Controller (DC)**. A Domain Controller is a server that manages network security, authentication, and access within an Active Directory domain. It centralizes user, group, and resource management, making it an essential part of domain environments.

## **Step 9.1**  
On the right-hand side of **`Server Manager`**, you will see several post-deployment warnings. These appeared after assigning server roles. Click on **`Promote this server to a domain controller`** to start the configuration process.  

> [!TIP]  
> A **Domain Controller** is essential for managing authentication, permissions, and resource allocation in an Active Directory environment.

![image](Images/60.png)

## **Step 9.2**  
A window will pop up with three options:  
1. **`Add a domain controller to an existing domain`**: This option is used to add redundancy or load balancing by adding an additional Domain Controller to an existing domain.  
2. **`Add a new domain to an existing forest`**: This option is chosen when you want to create a child domain or a new domain under an already established Active Directory forest.  
3. **`Add a new forest`**: This is the option we will select for this project, as we are starting a completely new domain environment.

Select **`Add a new forest`**, enter your root domain name (e.g., **`projectdomain.com`**), and click **`Next`**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> A new forest is required when creating a completely independent domain structure, ideal for labs or new organizations.

![image](Images/61.png)

## **Step 9.3**  
On the **`Domain Controller Options`** page, leave all options as default. Set a password for the **`Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)`**, which is used for recovery operations.  

> [!TIP]

## **Step 11.9**  
For the default gateway, enter the static IP address of the server (**`10.10.0.1`**), click **`Add`**, and then click **`Next`**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The default gateway directs traffic to the correct network, ensuring internal clients can communicate with external networks.  

![image](Images/89.png)

![image](Images/90.png)

## **Step 11.10**  
Ensure the DNS name and DNS server IP (**`10.10.0.1`**) are preconfigured. If they are correct, leave them as is and press **`Next`**.  

![image](Images/91.png)

## **Step 11.11**  
Leave the **WINS Server** field blank and click **`Next`**.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> WINS is a legacy technology. Adding unnecessary configurations could cause conflicts in modern environments.

![image](Images/92.png)

## **Step 11.12**  
Select **`Yes, I want to activate this scope now`** and click **`Next`** to complete the wizard.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Activating the scope ensures DHCP clients can begin requesting IP addresses immediately.

![image](Images/93.png)

## **Step 11.13**  
Back in the DHCP console, right-click the DHCP server and select **`Authorize`**.  

> [!TIP]  
> Authorization is required to enable the DHCP server to lease IP addresses. If the status doesnâ€™t turn green, refresh the page.

![image](Images/94.png)

![image](Images/95.png)

## **Step 11.14**  
Expand the **`IPv4`** contents, right-click **`Server Options`**, and select **`Configure Options`**.  

![image](Images/96.png)

## **Step 11.15**  
Tick **`003 Router`** and enter the gateway IP address (**`10.10.0.1`**) again, as it wasnâ€™t added during the initial DHCP configuration. Click **`Add`** and then **`OK`**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Adding the router option ensures all devices know how to reach the gateway for external communication.

# **15. Organizing OUs, Creating Accounts, and Managing Group Assignments in AD**

In this step, we will organize **Organizational Units (OUs)**, create user accounts with varying privileges, and manage group assignments in **Active Directory (AD)**.

## **Step 15.1**  
On the **Windows Server**, go to the **Start Menu**, search for **`Active Directory Users and Computers`**, and press **`Enter`**.  

![image](Images/134.png)

## **Step 15.2**  
Right-click on your **Domain Controller**, go to **`New`**, and then click on **`Organizational Unit (OU)`**.  

> [!TIP]  
> An **Organizational Unit (OU)** is a container in AD used to group users, computers, and other objects. OUs make it easier to manage and apply policies for specific departments or groups.  

![image](Images/135.png)

## **Step 15.3**  
Create multiple OUs based on your preference. For this example, I am treating OUs as departments and naming them accordingly (e.g., **`Sales`**, **`Admins`**, etc.). 

![image](Images/136.png)  

![image](Images/137.png)

## **Step 15.4**  
To add a user with admin privileges, right-click on the **`Admins OU`** you created, go to **`New`**, and select **`User`**. 

![image](Images/138.png)

## **Step 15.5**  
Provide the user's **First Name**, **Last Name**, and a **User Logon Name**. It is good practice to format the logon name as **`FirstInitial.LastName`** (e.g., **`P.Popa`**, **`J.Doe`** ect). Once completed, press **`Next`**.  

![image](Images/139.png)

## **Step 15.6**  
Set a password for the user. For this lab, I will make the password **`never expire`** for convenience. However, in a real-world scenario, this option should remain unchecked for security purposes. Press **`Next`**.

![image](Images/140.png)

## **Step 15.7**  
Confirm the account details and press **`Finish`** to create the user.

![image](Images/141.png)

## **Step 15.8**  
To give this user admin privileges, right-click the account and select **`Add to Group`**.

![image](Images/142.png)

## **Step 15.9**  
In the **Select Groups** window, type **`Domain Admins`**, click **`Check Names`**, and then press **`OK`**.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The underlined group name indicates it has been successfully validated in AD. If you donâ€™t know the exact group name, you can type the first few letters and click **`Check Names`**. This will display matching groups with similar names. Once you select the desired group and press **`OK`**, it will be automatically added to the field with an underline, confirming it exists in AD.  


![image](Images/143.png)

![image](Images/144.png)

![image](Images/145.png)

## **Step 15.10**  
You should now see a confirmation message stating the user has been successfully added to the **`Domain Admins`** group. Press **`OK`**. 

![image](Images/146.png)

## **Step 15.11**  
Next, create a regular user with standard privileges in the **`Sales OU`**. Right-click on the **`Sales OU`**, go to **`New`**, and select **`User`**. 

![image](Images/147.png)

## **Step 15.12**  
Provide the user's details as done in **[Step 15.5](#step-155)** and press **`Next`**. 

![image](Images/148.png)

## **Step 15.13**  
Set a password for the user, following the same process as in **[Step 15.6](#step-156)**. Press **`Next`** and then **`Finish`** to finalize.  

![image](Images/149.png)

![image](Images/150.png)

## **Step 15.14**  
Since this is a regular user, it should already be in the **`Domain Users`** group by default. To verify, right-click on the account, then click **`Properties`**.   

![image](Images/151.png)

![image](Images/152.png)

## **Step 15.15**  
In the **`Member Of`** tab, confirm that the user is already part of the **`Domain Users`** group by default.  

![image](Images/153.png) 

> [!TIP]  
> You can use the same method to verify that the admin account has been correctly added to the **`Domain Admins`** group.

# **16. Verifying Client Network Connectivity and IP Configuration**

In this step, we will verify that the client VM has been successfully added to the domain, assigned an IP address by the DHCP server, and has internet connectivity.

## **Step 16.1**  
Connect to the client VM (**`Project-Client`**) and you will be prompted to log in. Instead of logging into the local **Project-Client** account, click **`Other User`** and enter the credentials for the domain user account (e.g., **Paul Sales** with the logon name **`p.sales`**).  

![image](Images/155.png)

## **Step 16.2**  
Once logged in, open **CMD** and run the following commands to verify domain, IP configuration, and internet connectivity:  

### **Command 1**: **`whoami`**  
This command displays the current user and domain. The output should confirm you are logged in as **`projectdomain\p.sales`**.  

> [!TIP]  
> The `whoami` command helps verify the domain and user context under which you are logged in.

---

### **Command 2**: **`ipconfig`**  
This command shows the IP configuration of the machine. The output will display the following:  
- **DNS Suffix**: Indicates the domain name (e.g., **projectdomain.com**).  
- **IPv4 Address**: Displays the IP address assigned by the DHCP server (e.g., **10.10.0.100**).  

> [!NOTE]  
> In this example, the client received **10.10.0.100**, which is within the scope configured earlier (**10.10.0.100 - 10.10.0.200**). Since this is the first client to join the domain, it was assigned the first available IP in the range.

---

### **Command 3**: **`ping www.google.com`**  
This command tests internet connectivity. The output will confirm the ability to send and receive packets over the internet:  
- **Packets Sent**: 4  
- **Packets Received**: 4  
- **Packets Lost**: 0  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Successful packet transmission and receipt indicate that the client can communicate with external networks, verifying the correct configuration of **NAT** on the server.

![image](Images/156.png)

## **Step 16.3**  
Go back to **Server Manager** on the server VM and open the **DHCP** window. Navigate to **`Address Leases`** under **IPv4**. Here, you will see the following details about the client machine:  
- **IP Address**: Confirms that the DHCP server assigned an IP address (e.g., **10.10.0.100**) to the client.  
- **Client Name**: Displays the name of the client machine.  
- **Lease Expiry**: Shows when the IP lease will expire.  
- **Lease Type**: Indicates that the IP address was automatically assigned by the DHCP server.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Verifying the address lease in the DHCP window helps confirm that the serverâ€™s DHCP scope is functioning correctly and has successfully assigned an IP address to the client.  

![image](Images/157.png)

## **Step 16.4**  
Open **Active Directory Users and Computers** on the server VM and navigate to **`Computers`**. You should see the client VM listed by the name you assigned earlier during the setup process (e.g., **Project-Client**).  

> [!TIP]  
> Checking **Computers** in AD ensures the client machine has been successfully joined to the domain and is being tracked within the domain environment.
