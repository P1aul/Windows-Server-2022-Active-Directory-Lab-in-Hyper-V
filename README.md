# **2. Creating an Office & Internet vNIC**

In this step, we will create two virtual network interfaces (vNICs) in Hyper-V.
- The first, the Internet vNIC, will allow the server to access the internet and share connectivity with client devices.
- The second, the Office vNIC, will enable internal communication between the server and client devices within a private network.
- These vNICs will work together to simulate a real-world network, with the server acting as a gateway for internet access and managing internal office communications.

## **Step 2.1**  
In **Hyper-V Manager**, click on **`Virtual Switch Manager`**.

# **6. Initial Server Setup and Customization**

In this step, we will configure the initial basic settings for Windows Server 2022, including enabling network discovery, setting the time zone, and customizing the server name.

## **Step 6.1**  
After logging in with the administrator credentials, you will see a network pop-up asking if you want the PC to be discoverable. Click **Allow**.  

*Quick Tip*: 
- Allowing the server to be discoverable enables communication with other devices on the same network, which is essential for domain functionality.  

![image](Images/31.png)  


## **Step 6.2**  
Under **Local Server** in the left-hand menu of **Server Manager**, click on the time zone setting to update it.

# **7. Configuring and Identifying Network Interfaces (NICs)**

In this step, we will identify the serverâ€™s network interfaces (NICs) and configure the Internal (Office) NIC with a static IP address to ensure reliable communication within the private network. The External (Internet) NIC will remain configured to use DHCP to automatically obtain an IP address from the router for internet connectivity.

## **Step 7.1**  
Under **Local Server** in **Server Manager**, click on one of the **`IPv4 address assigned by DHCP, IPv6 enabled`** links. This will open the **Network Connections** window.  

![image](Images/38.png)  


## **Step 7.2**  
In the **Network Connections** window, you will see two Ethernet connections. To identify which is internal and which is external, right-click each NIC, select **Status**, and then click **Details**.  

![image](Images/39.png)

![image](Images/40.png)


## **Step 7.3**  
In the **Network Connection Details** window:  
- **Ethernet**: Displays an address like `169.254.x.x`, which is an APIPA address. This indicates the NIC is likely the **Internal NIC**, as it could not get an IP address from the router via DHCP.  
- **Ethernet 2**: Displays an address like `192.168.x.x`, assigned by the router via DHCP, making it the **External NIC**.   

![image](Images/41.png)

- Rename the NICs accordingly (e.g., **Internal (Office)** and **External (Internet)**) to track their roles. 

![image](Images/42.png)  

## **Step 7.4**  
Now that the NICs are identified, assign a static IP address to the **Internal (Office)** NIC. Right-click the renamed NIC, select **Properties**, then select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**. 

*Quick Tip*: 
- Assigning a static IP ensures consistent network communication within the domain, as the address wonâ€™t change like it might with DHCP.  

![image](Images/43.png) ![image](Images/44.png)


## **Step 7.5**  
In the IPv4 settings, change from **`Obtain an IP address automatically`** to **`Use the following IP address`**. Enter the following:  
- **IP Address**: `10.10.0.1`  
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`  
- **Default Gateway**: Leave this blank.  
- **DNS Server**: Use either `10.10.0.1` (server IP) or `127.0.0.1` (loopback address).
 
*Quick Tip*:
- The loopback address (`127.0.0.1`) allows the server to resolve its hostname without querying an external DNS server.  

![image](Images/45.png)


## **Step 7.6**  
The **External (Internet)** NIC is already set to receive an IP address via DHCP from the router. No further configuration is needed for this NIC.
